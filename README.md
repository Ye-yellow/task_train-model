 You can download the model by visiting SparseEnNet (https://github.com/junyachen/sparseennet), and then place the homewk.txt file into the SparseEnNet\data folder to start training.


# introduce
I completed the task of training a recommendation system model by referencing SparseEnNet (https://github.com/junyachen/sparseennet).

I organized the Kuai dataset (https://kuairec.com/) as the training dataset for the model.

# homewk.txt

homewk.txt references the Kuai dataset and constructs it into a user-video sequence. The construction process is as follows: video IDs are grouped based on user IDs, thus forming a sequence chain of user-video interactions.

# create_homewk.ipynb

This document explains the process of how I integrated the Kuai dataset.

# use.txt
In this document, you can see how to train and test the model through the instructions.
