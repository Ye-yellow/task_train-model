# introduce
I completed the task of training a recommendation system model by referencing SparseEnNet (https://github.com/junyachen/sparseennet).

I organized the Kuai dataset (https://kuairec.com/) as the training dataset for the model.

# homewk.txt

homewk.txt references the Kuai dataset (https://kuairec.com/) and constructs it into a user-video sequence. The construction process is as follows: video IDs are grouped based on user IDs, thus forming a sequence chain of user-video interactions.
